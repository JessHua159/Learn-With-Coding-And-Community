# Learn-With-Coding-And-Community
This is a web-based application that is to be directly deployed onto the official Coding&amp;&amp;Community club [website]( https://codingandcommunity.org/) as an additional learning feature. It is to be added to the main site in the form of an additional tab on the upper toolbar with the name of this web-app. Clicking on the tab enables users to log into their Coding&&Community account (username/email & password) onto a separate website where they can complete curriculum, register for hackathons, and receive advice.
